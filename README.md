# Task-Schedular
This Task Scheduler project sends automated email notifications to remind users about upcoming deadlines, using Node.js, Nodemailer, and `node-schedule` to schedule emails based on task due dates. It allows scheduling emails 1 hour before the task's deadline, ensuring timely reminders.
